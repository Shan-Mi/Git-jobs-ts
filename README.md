# TS version with Tailwind
[Demo link](https://git-jobs-ts.web.app/)

## Test code snippet
- `yarn test src/Components/__test__/JobListItem.test.tsx`
- `yarn test src/Components/__test__/JobDetail.test.tsx`
- `yarn test src/App.test.tsx`

> Coverage is poorly printed. Function test and state test will need more time, will not continue with this project anymore.

Convert old js version into ts, including tests.

Implemented Tailwind for styling (very simple and basic, just for testing's purpose)

## TODO:

- check **@apply {}** (maybe only for components' level not for page?? to be checked)
